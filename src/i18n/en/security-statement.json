Although we utilize reasonable information security measures as described above, no information security measures, data transmission over the Internet, or data storage method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable methods to protect our products, notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, we do not offer any guarantee or other unconditional assurance of complete security."
