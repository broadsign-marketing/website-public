However, we receive a high volume of applications and because of this, are unable to provide prospective candidates with personalized feedback. That being said, we encourage you to ask questions about the application process, particularly if you have landed an interview with one of our hiring managers. "

				"q": "Who is reviewing my application?",

			},
			{
				"q": "Why did I receive an automated rejection email? ",

			},
			{
				"q": "Can I still apply for a position if I'm planning on relocating? ",
				"a": "For now, we only consider applicants who are already legally eligible to work in the country that a specific job is based. Although possible, visa sponsorship is rare and mainly for specialized positions. "
			},
			{
				"q": "What is the interview process like? ",
				"a": "As a company, we value your time. For this reason, we try to streamline the interview process—you'll never be asked to fulfill more than four interviews at a time. We'll even provide you with the opportunity to meet with at least one member of your future team. Keep in mind that during the interview process, we may require assessments such as technical tests, presentations, writing samples, or more. "
			},
			{
				"q": "Based on the job posting, I would be a good fit, but I wasn't offered an interview. Why?",
				"a": "Our top priority is ensuring the candidate is the right fit for the job opening. Due to the sheer volume of high-quality candidates and our limited time frame, we unfortunately cannot schedule interviews with all candidates. However, we will keep your resumé on file for a future role if we see you would be a good fit. "
			},
			{
				"q": "How do I know if the salary aligns with my expectations?",
				"a": "We strive to be transparent with regards to salary expectations, and will do our best to maintain an open dialogue. If there are specific questions you have about salary, we encourage you to discuss with the hiring manager. "
