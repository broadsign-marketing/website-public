# Prerequisites

-   [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/) : Node v20.18.0 is recommended.
-   [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/) : Yarn v3.3.0 is recommended, and preferred over npm or pnpm.

# Getting Started

## Clone Repo and Install

Clone the repo in the directory of your choice and then move to this new directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/broadsign-marketing/website.git
cd website
yarn
```

Set your Git client to the **staging** branch. **We do not develop on Master**.

It is advised to create a new branch, from the current state of Staging, as a starting point for any new page, component, feature etc.

# Development

## Start Gatsby

Run in the root of the project :

```
yarn dev
```

Starting the server should take a few minutes. It'll be longer the first time because GatsbyJS has to fetch a few thousand images from Wordpress. Eventually you'll be able to open the site at https://localhost:8000.

# Hosting

We are hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/broadsign/overview).

We have different installs :

-   **[Production](https://broadsign.com/)**
-   **[Staging](https://staging.broadsign.com/)**
-   **[Webdev](https://webdev.broadsign.com/)** : Development install.
-   **[Webwip](https://webwip.broadsign.com/)** : Development install.
-   **[Webtest](https://webtest.broadsign.com/)** : Test install.

# Deployment

Builds on Netlify take :

-   2 to 4 minutes in most cases ;
-   About 15 minutes if the install isn't new but something has been changed in the configs ;
-   Up to 30 minutes if the install is absolutely fresh or the cache has been cleared.

## Branches

Create branches as needed, based on staging, to develop changes. Merge that branch to staging for final approval by the team. Once approved, [create a pull request from staging to master](https://github.com/broadsign-marketing/website/compare/master...staging).
